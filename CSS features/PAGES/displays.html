    <b>An element with display block. </b> <br>
    The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.
    Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
    A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
